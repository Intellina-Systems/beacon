# machine: a zsh login shell, but $SHELL resolved to bash inside the script, so
# the key landed in ~/.bashrc and a zsh session never sourced it). Rather than
# guess which shell is authoritative, write to both common profiles — each guard
# is idempotent, so this is safe to re-run regardless of which shell is active.
